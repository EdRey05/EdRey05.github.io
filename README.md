    <h2> Interactive extraction of gene expression data from the CCLE/DepMap database </h2>
    <p><strong> Summary </strong></p>
    <p> More than <strong>1,800 cancer cell lines</strong> have had genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data measured as part of the CCLE/DepMap project. During my graduate studies, I searched for suitable cell models or compared various models in thyroid, breast, and pancreatic cancers using the <strong>gene expression</strong> (RNA Seq) dataset, which contains approximately <strong>20,000 genes</strong>. Since we frequently used less than 10 for our research and the datasets are updated frequently (two to three times a year), I created tools to automate the extraction of the cell lines of interest from the database (Jupyter/Colab Notebooks and Streamlit app). </p>

    ## Automated generation of summary Power Point presentations for PLA results
    **Summary**
    During my graduate studies I performed numerous confocal microscopy experiments, including **Proximity Ligation Assays**, which detect protein-protein interactions. I optimized a complete workflow in my research group, from automated image acquisition, to image pre-processing and quantification. I designed and wrote multiple scripts to quantify images in ImageJ/Fiji, and the resulting number of interactions were statistically analyzed. I developed a tool (Jupyter/Colab Notebook and Streamlit app) to generate summaries of the images and their quantification results, which helped in comparing different quantification methods, identifying optimal pre-processing/quantification parameters, and validating the consistency of the results.

    ## Interactive generation of Kaplan-Meier survival plots
    **Summary**
    As part of my graduate duties, I helped two bachelor's students working in my research group to analyze data from clinical trials that could suggest the association of increased expression of a gene (RET) with bad clinical prognosis. For this purpose, we retrieved data available in CBioPortal, and generated survival curves for diverse studies and groups of patients of interest (such as the METABRIC breast cancer trial). During this process, I gained great interest towards this type of analyses and generated tools (Jupyter/Colab Notebooks and Streamlit app) to automate the calculation and plotting of survival curves using the `KaplanMeierFitter` library in python.
