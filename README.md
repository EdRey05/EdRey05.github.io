    <h2> Interactive extraction of gene expression data from the CCLE/DepMap database </h2>
    <p><strong> Summary </strong></p>
    <p> More than <strong>1,800 cancer cell lines</strong> have had genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data measured as part of the CCLE/DepMap project. During my graduate studies, I searched for suitable cell models or compared various models in thyroid, breast, and pancreatic cancers using the <strong>gene expression</strong> (RNA Seq) dataset, which contains approximately <strong>20,000 genes</strong>. Since we frequently used less than 10 for our research and the datasets are updated frequently (two to three times a year), I created tools to automate the extraction of the cell lines of interest from the database (Jupyter/Colab Notebooks and Streamlit app). </p>

    <h2> Automated generation of summary Power Point presentations for PLA results </h2>
    <p><strong> Summary </strong></p>
    <p> During my graduate studies I performed numerous confocal microscopy experiments, including <strong>Proximity Ligation Assays</strong>, which detect <strong>protein-protein interactions</strong>. I optimized a complete workflow for my research group, from automated image acquisition, to image pre-processing and quantification. I designed and wrote multiple scripts to quantify images in <strong>ImageJ/Fiji</strong>, and the resulting number of interactions were statistically analyzed. I developed a tool (Jupyter/Colab Notebook and Streamlit app) to generate summaries of the images and their quantification results, which helped in comparing different quantification methods, identifying optimal pre-processing/quantification parameters, and validating the consistency of the results.  <p>

    <h2> Interactive generation of Kaplan-Meier survival plots </h2>
    <p><strong> Summary </strong></p>
    <p> As part of my graduate duties, I helped two bachelor's students working in my research group to analyze data from clinical trials that could suggest the association of increased <strong>gene expression</strong> (RET) with bad <strong>clinical prognosis</strong>. For this purpose, we retrieved data available in <strong>CBioPortal</strong>, and generated <strong>survival curves</strong> for diverse studies and groups of patients of interest (such as the METABRIC breast cancer trial). During this process, I gained great interest towards this type of analyses and generated tools (Jupyter/Colab Notebooks and Streamlit app) to automate the calculation and plotting of survival curves using the <code>KaplanMeierFitter</code> library in python. </p>
